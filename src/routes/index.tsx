            This Started With <em>Our Founder's Dad</em>.
          </h2>
          <p className={styles.storyP}>
            Our founder's father was a dialysis patient. For years she watched him travel to the hospital just to book a session, ask a question, get a refill, or confirm a result � things a simple website or booking page could have handled in seconds. The clinic had no online presence. The pharmacy had no online presence. Most of the services he depended on had no digital front door at all.
          </p>
          <p className={styles.storyP}>
            He has since passed on, but the gap he lived with every day is still here � and it's still hurting families like ours. So many local businesses � clinics, pharmacies, schools, small service providers � are invisible online, and the people who need them suffer for it. Kavaro exists in his memory, to change that one honest website at a time.
          </p>
          <p className={styles.storyP}>
            I’m a UI/UX Product Designer and Creative Director at Kavaro, currently studying
            Software Engineering at Moringa School. I work across JavaScript, React, Python and
            Node.js building modern web systems with a strong focus on usability and performance.
          </p>

          <p className={styles.storyP}>
            My background includes foundational training in Cybersecurity, giving me a strong
            understanding of secure system thinking. I am also a certified UI/UX Designer, having
            graduated from Moringa School's intensive Bootcamp , where I developed skills in
            user-centered design, wireframing, prototyping, and creating intuitive digital
            experiences. Additionally, I hold a certification in Generative AI Essentials, which
            strengthens how I approach AI-powered product features and automation.
          </p>

          <p className={styles.storyP}>
            At Kavaro, we combine design thinking, modern engineering and practical AI capabilities to build digital products that genuinely work for the businesses and people using them.
